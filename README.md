## Emotiometer
#### by Sophia Ladwiniec


### Overview
It is hard to keep in touch with our emotions. Emotiometer is here to help! Similar to a fit bit, the Emotiometer will track your daily emotions throughout the day. At the start you will be allowed to choose your character names. After that each screen will lead to a different storyline and will track your emotions as you make decisions. 


### How it works
Each page will have a series of options to choose from that will be clickables. Based on which clickable you click you will be brought to different scenarios that will lead to different endings. Each ending will say the end after the text so that you know the story is over. 

### Technical Details 
To plan this project I used Adobe Xd to plan out each state and as well what items would take you to which pages.

For this project I used p5.js. I implemented the clickable library and also designed my own classes as those well those being screen setup and screen. Screen setup reads from my csvs to gather my data to populate the screens, each screen is a screen object. For the clickable library I implemented it inorder to allow buttons to be clickable objects and allow for changes of states. In addition to these I used maps, arrays, global and local variables, groups, and callback functions.
